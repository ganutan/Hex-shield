# Hex-shield
Built automated tools in Maya in Python language to make an attractive animation.

Manufactured tools in Maya corresponding to :
1. Ordered Selection and Aimed Constraints
2. Creating run-time UI interfaces for accepting user input
3. Adding Custom Attributes to a scene
4. Creating expressions to drive the value of other objects' attributes 

Added UV shaders and materials for greater effect. 

These scripts are functional in Autodesk Maya's script editor.
